# Raptors-NBA-Insight-Platform

Created a relational database using SQL to store 25 years of Raptors team statistics - including wins, losses, and rankings, with year-by-year breakdowns for detailed trend analysis using Plotly and Matplotlib in Python

Integrated XGBoost to forecast future wins and rankings based on historical time series data, achieving a R² of 0.3, and RMSE of 1.5, delivering actionable insights based on trends for sports analysts and enthusiasts

Tuned Hyperparameters in model using Grid Search, and cross validation, to find the best parameters
